# Meshtastic-Firmware-Friend-Finder-Edition
This is a custom build of the official Meshtastic firmware that introduces the Friend Finder module. Developed over several months, this feature adds previously unsupported magnetometer (compass) capabilities to Meshtastic, allowing you to pair with and track your friends in real-time.
